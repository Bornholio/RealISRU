// This script takes advantage of ModuleManager's directive to alter the second resource.
// In cases where there is only one resource, the second index 1 is treated as the first 0
// so that a resource always gets the "testval" added.  We can then check against whether
// the first resource has the testval to exclude any tanks that have resources other than
// monopropellant or ore.

// This means we exclude tanks that represent complex service modules and instead only
// copy proper RCS or Ore tanks.  We'll also catch some specific cases with this to
// avoid some other improper situations, like the Mk2 Docking Port.

// Individual part copy scripts will take advantage of this as needed depending on the
// installed mods, but this is common to the Tank Ppam, Firespitter, and Interstellar Fuel
// switch methods.
